**I hit the snooze button on my overwhelming work schedule and Go Goa Gone to take a much deserved detour**

### Day 1 - Thursday, November 24, 2022
The baniya inside the Aggarwal booked the flight tickets **two months** in advance. The flight was Chandigarh-Delhi-Goa and I thought that there are no direct flights until a week ago when I found out üò≤ that there were direct flights that too around the same price I booked. Did nothing much, arrived Goa at 7:30 PM and reached Candolim at our [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/53588509?check_in=2023-01-29&check_out=2023-02-03&guests=1&adults=8&s=67&unique_share_id=74f7e97d-209d-47fe-b81d-f025ef0f012e) at 9:00PM. Daaru was brought in advance by [Happy Dhillon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhillon-harpreet/). After two shots in and went to Candolim, an amazing dine-in in [Uptown](https://www.instagram.com/uptowngoa) and enjoyed the live music there. Had a walk at Candolim Beach.

### Day 2 - Friday, November 25, 2022
Went to hire [Activas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Activa) for rent first thing in the morning. Had breakfast at a very bad place, nothing good opens before 10 AM in Goa, and if you are in a similar situation you will ask yourself, why you are a morning person in Goa. We visited [Aguada Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Aguada), what a hot day it was!

Shopped for fancy shirts in the afternoon, the Goan vibe!

Got swollen thumbs by playing volleyball in the evening at Candolim Beach. Lost my spectacles by running and lying into the waves. Bought groceries for the breakfast. We had dinner and shots at a highly recommended place - [Inferno](https://www.zomato.com/goa/inferno-candolim) but didn't like it much.

But Punjabis carry their Vibe and I gave a tribute to the legend himself, [Sidhu Moose Wala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidhu_Moose_Wala).

### Day 3 - Saturday, November 26, 2022
I made breakfast for our everybody üòÅ. We played voleyball once again but this time in the pool.

I had to switch to my Prescription Powered Sunglasses for the whole tour. Thank God I carried them! On our way to visit the [Alcohol Museum](https://www.instagram.com/alcoholmuseum), I was handed over a visiting card for a Spa by a bypasser. Everyone except me (no I am not lying) wanted to have the experience and went for a spin. I was told to have lunch nearby in case of an SOS. While midway to the Airbnb, I got a call from [TG](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarungupta2811/) to pick them back up as it turned out to be a fraud ü§£.

Yes, you guessed right, we didn't visit the Alcohol Museum.
In the evening the Old Goa visit was planned but was vetoed and the main highlight of  the day was a Cruise Casino. [Maddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitgoyal1125) and I reached first at one casino and booked tickets too quickly to avoid getting sold out on a weekend, even when TG and [Dhillon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhillon-harpreet/) had lost way and were midway. When they reached at last, to our surprise, both of them were in shorts and were not allowed to enter ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Unable to find trousers nearby, they went all the way back to Airbnb, Candolim  to change and then again came back. They were an hour late ü´°. I got celebrity attention, thanks to my sunglasses which I was wearing at night. What a vibe there was on the Skybar! I along with Dhillon had too many cocktails.

Both of us had to be carried back to the Airbnb, courtesy of Maddy and TG. I and a drunk Dhillon were vomiting on our way back to the Airbnb, which was enough to get them off of their two shots high üòÖ. I feel sorry and grateful to them at the same time üòÇ. There's nothing to write much about because you didn't drink enough if you remember what happened. Apparently the dinner was really great, which Dhillon and I didn't even taste.

### Day 4 - Sunday, November 27, 2022
I woke up with a very bad hangover, dizzy head and severe heartburn. While we were asleep Maddy and TG were out to bring medicines and the Activas parked at the Casino üòÖ. Dhillon made scrambled eggs for ailing me. He was cooking them for the first time, and that too in a very bad hangover. I felt better after taking medicines with coconut water. We checked out to move into our next location [goStops Baga](https://gostops.com/book-rooms-in-goabaga-hostel/).

{{< video src="/static/images/goa/checkout.mp4" type="video/mp4" preload="auto" loop="true" description="We can definitely carry more luggage on an Activa than a standard hatchback">}}


Daru, Chakna and whatnot were dumped into the goStops Fridge. Visited the very scenic Anjuna Beach, had simple lunch to my delight and everyone's dismay and played with a [Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbee) at the Baga beach. I got a recommendation for a [Pure Veg Restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/et7ASw9YKgiDgBo6A) nearby from the [Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/fkbHucYEfMa7jZ889) we bought TG's Birthday Cake. I loved the meal. My stomach was feeling so acidic, I just ate Pure Vegetarian throughout the whole tour, even missed trying out Sea Food, I have to make another visit for that. We played [Jenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenga), celebrated TG's birthday with all the hostel inmates, and danced and partied hard. Sunglasses in the night, weird stares. No shots for me. Dhillon can be seen drinking shots with the chocolate cake.

### Day 5 - Monday, November 28, 2022
We are usually not on time, but this time we were and were waiting at the designated spot for the Coach to take us to the water sports, but God doesn't like the normal ways for us. We had to follow the Coach and boarded a ferry to the Grand Islands where the water sports would take place. It was spanned for the whole day and we were scheduled to return in the evening. It was around one hour journey, to everyone's plight and my pleasure Poha was served in Breakfast. On the way, a fellow traveller explained the possible danger of a jellyfish sting. The very first activity was Scuba Diving. I went in the water and could breathe in but as soon as we got a little deeper, I would start losing breath, so I didn't do it properly. So didn't Dhillon, we both had the same diver, so we thought maybe it is because of the diver, who didn't give us good enough training. We jumped into the ocean to take a swim where I was already panting because neither there was some safety rope, nor I was able to swim because the really strong waves pushed me very far away from the ferry. To add more salt, someone shouted Jellyfish and I got really panicked. Thanks to TG and another guy I was safely escorted back to the ferry.
We got ferried again to a beach in South Goa, where the other activities - Para Sailing, Bumper Ride, Banana Ride, Jet Ski, was to take place. Since the wind was very strong and hence the waves, a lot of people were feeling nauseatic, and were vomiting. It was enough to make me feel nauseous today as my heartbeat was already first. People were happy - making a lot of noises, in lunch fish was served - which was really smelly, and it made conditions worse for me. The guys went parasailing and I skipped. Due to the strong winds, the boat was shaking very much and a lot of people had boarded off, and I was not feeling any good either. I tried to sleep, and I don't know when I missed the call to go to the other water sports, and in this way, all of this day went in vain and I just sat the whole day on the ferry üòî.
Another reason to plan another visit.
I loved üòç yesterday's dinner at [Anand Pure Veg Restaurant]((https://goo.gl/maps/et7ASw9YKgiDgBo6A)) and the cakes at [Big Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/fkbHucYEfMa7jZ889), so I repeated the same. I became their repeat customer.

### Day 6 - Tuesday, November 29, 2022
This was our last day in Goa! Maddy and I were on Activa and TG and Dhillon on another. The first stop was at the Shiva's Face at Vagator beach. It was a really scorching sun out here instead of yesterday's windy day.
After that, we headed for Arambol beach. TG drove too fast and went into a no-entry-zone and we just got saved from getting a big challan. With TG's fast driving and Dhillon's excellent navigation skills, they reached Morjim, while Maddy and I were at Arambol. This was the first time we saw these many foreigners in one place.
Then we headed for lunch at Morjim Beach where TG and Dhillon were already waiting for us. I had a sun bath, an amazingly simple Dal at Lunch, and a quick nap at the beach amongst the sea breeze! ü§©
Soon it was time to return back to goStops Baga.
Since we didn't drink much on the trip - booze, chakna and groceries ü•≤.
At night, while Maddy and I were on our way to return the hired Activas, TG called me to inform that the Taxi Drivers around are not allowing our booked cab driver to pick him up from goStops and are creating a scene. They hit his car as well. I just thought why can't we get just a single simple thing straight.
We are very thankful to the staff at goStops, who helped us deal with the situation, and made sure we board our return flight on time.

PS. We had a late night connecting flight, it was awkardly tiring. I had now been habitual, and wasn't bothered at all of the stares I got at the security check, airport and in-flight. Lesson Learnt - never book too early, never book connecting flights, and never ever a late-night connecting flight. Should lay a broad itinerary for the tour. Carry an extra pair of spectacles. Don't mix different types of alcohol, and if you want to mix still, don't drink too many of them.

With our bags and memories packed, we flew out of Goa, until next time!
