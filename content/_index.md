Hey there! Welcome to my personal homepage.
I am Sanyam, and I love to solve real life problems for mass benefit.

I am a Software Engineer at [Shipsy](https://shipsy.io). At Shipsy, our motto is to be the enabler for every mode of logistics that exists while being best at it - 'Ship' anything and everything via 'Shipsy'.

I started my journey in 2020 (yeah COVID-19, WFH) as a Software Engineering Intern in an On-Demand Logistics Solution Product (fancy name for 30 minute delivery, if you are wondering) and fell in love with the problem and the challenges it brings along ever since.

Apart from what I do @ Shipsy, I particularly enjoy watching content about music and cars - drive reviews, repairs, trades, paint jobs, basically everything about cars! No brownie points for guessing, I fell in love with our family's first car when I was 4.
I like to hobby-code, workout, swim, sing, travel to new places and spend time with my family.

### My First Steps on the Tech Ladder

I discovered computers at my Uncle's office when I was 6, and had access to a computer since then. I became your go to guy for PC, Phone recommendations. I had dreamy eyes - I wanted to take up all my passions professionally - techie, honest people serving government official, automobile desinger, playback singer, and a lawyer - to name a few I fancied more amongst others. These are some of the professions which I fancied the most amongst many others. Eventually I joined [NIT Jalandhar](https://www.nitj.ac.in/) in 2016 to learn more about what goes behind the tech.

### Are you climbing the right ladder ?

One year into the college and I found the course work realy boring and fell out of the love for Tech. So now I took the oppurtunity and the free time to prepare for UPSC instead of killing it.

I studied for UPSC between 2017 - 2019. I try to keep an eye on what goes in and around domestic and international politics and economics, when I can.

I have reserved the story how I got again into tech. Until next time.
