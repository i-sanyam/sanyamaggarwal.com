Hey there! Welcome to my personal homepage.
I am Sanyam, and I love to solve real life problems for mass benefit.

I am a Software Engineer at [Shipsy](https://shipsy.io). At Shipsy, our motto is to be the enabler for every mode of logistics that exists while being best at it. 'Ship' anything via Shipsy

I started my journey in 2020 (yeah COVID-19, WFH) as a Software Engineering Intern in an On-Demand Logistics Solution Product (fancy name for 30 minute delivery, if you are wondering) and fell in **love** with the problem and the challenges it brings along ever since.

Apart from what I do @ Shipsy, I particularly enjoy watching content about music and cars - drive reviews, repairs, trades, paint jobs, basically everything ! No brownie points for guessing, I fell in love with our family's first car when I was 4.
I like to hobby code at weekends, work out, swim, travel to new places and spending time with my family.

In school, I was an average student academically. I discovered computers at my Uncle's office when I was 6, and had access to a computer since then. I became your go to guy for PC, Phone recommendations and joined [NIT Jalandhar](https://www.nitj.ac.in/) in 2016 to learn more about what goes behind the tech.

I found the course work realy boring and fell out of the love for Tech. I fancied becoming an honest people serving Government Official earlier, in high school, and now took the free time to prepare for UPSC instead of killing it.

I have reserved the story how I got into tech again for the time we meet. I studied for UPSC from 2018 - 2020 and keep an eye on what goes around in domestic and international politics and economics, when I can.

I have been documenting my journey of tech and life, and still 

``Living to Learn, Learning to Live``

This website is a collection of my [**musings**](/blog), the insights I've gained and I want to share.
