Welcome to my personal homepage.
I am Sanyam, and I love to solve real life problems for mass benefit.</p><p>I am a Software Engineer at <a href=https://shipsy.io>Shipsy</a>. At Shipsy, our motto is to be the enabler for every mode of logistics that exists while being best at it. &lsquo;Ship&rsquo; anything via Shipsy</p><p>I started my journey in 2020 (yeah COVID-19, WFH) as a Software Engineering Intern in an On-Demand Logistics Solution Product (fancy name for 30 minute delivery, if you are wondering) and fell in <strong>love</strong> with the problem and the challenges it brings along ever since.</p><p>Apart from what I do @ Shipsy, I particularly enjoy watching content about music and cars - drive reviews, repairs, trades, paint jobs, basically everything ! No brownie points for guessing, I fell in love with our family&rsquo;s first car when I was 4.
I like to hobby code at weekends, work out, swim, travel to new places and spending time with my family.</p><p><figure><img src=static/images/shipping.jpeg alt="Sanyam Aggarwal on a Boat"><figcaption>Shipping !</figcaption></figure></p><p>In school, I was an average student academically. I discovered computers at my Uncle&rsquo;s office when I was 6, and had access to a computer since then.

I fancied becoming an honest people serving Government Official earlier, in high school, and now took the free time to prepare for UPSC instead of killing it.</p><p><figure><img src=static/images/reliance-money.jpg alt="No title"><figcaption>IAS prep</figcaption></figure></p><p>I have reserved the story how I got into tech again for the time we meet. I studied for UPSC from 2018 - 2020 and keep an eye on what goes around in domestic and international politics and economics, when I can.</p><hr><p>I have been documenting my journey of tech and life, and still</p><p><code>Living to Learn, Learning to Live</code></p><p>This website is a collection of my <a href=/blog><strong>musings</strong></a>, the insights I&rsquo;ve gained and I want to share.</p><hr><p>Find me on <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanyamaggarwal>LinkedIn</a> and <a href=https://sanyamaggarwal.medium.com>Medium</a>.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Sanyam Aggarwal &copy; 2022</footer></body></html>
