We had written about this issue on the Rainmatter blog that using exchange data feeds for gaming involving money is an issue, since regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow it.
When regulations aren&amp;rsquo;t explicit or clear, it&amp;rsquo;s always better to do things in a regulatorily appropriate way, or always better to assume that you are regulated and do things that regulators would expect.</description></item><item><title>The symbolism behind Goddess Lakshmi sitting on a lotus and Goddess Saraswati sitting on a stone</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/symbolism-behind-lakshmi-and-saraswati/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/symbolism-behind-lakshmi-and-saraswati/</guid><description>As we celebrate Laksmi Puja this Deepavali, here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting anecdote.
Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, sits on a lotus. Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, sits on a rock.

Upfront penalty is on the broker if a client is allowed to trade with insufficient margins. Non-upfront is on the customer if there&amp;rsquo;s margin shortfall after entering a trade.
There&amp;rsquo;s been a debate over what&amp;rsquo;s an upfront penalty &amp;amp; what&amp;rsquo;s not.
If a broker ensures the required margin is available when entering trades, but if it goes up by EOD, is it upfront?</description></item><item><title>Health challenge at Zerodha</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/health-challenge-at-zerodha/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/health-challenge-at-zerodha/</guid><description>Our latest health challenge at Zerodha is to give an option to set a daily activity goal on our fitness trackers.

I usually say whatever the current trend will continue, as that is most probable.😃 But over the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been consistent that India will most likely outperform.
By outperforming, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean our markets will go up, but we will probably not fall as much as others. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t fall as much, we will probably outperform on the upside.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Varsity Certified</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/introducing-varsity-certified/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/introducing-varsity-certified/</guid><description>India can only do well if people are financially literate, &amp;amp; knowing about money is also a life skill.

Money cannot be withdrawn from trading accounts to 3rd party bank accounts. To move money, fraudsters create artificial losses by trading illiquid options (buy high, sell low) or buying scammy penny stocks.

Yield = ((Rent – interest - maintenance)/Total cost)%
If yield -ve, the price has to go up by at least 10% per yr to beat inflation, or the price has to double every ~7 years.
For the price of the property to double every 7 yrs, the rents also have to go up as much.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on real estate performance</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</guid><description>Being overexposed to real estate worked well for the current &amp;gt; 50-year-olds, as returns beat inflation+interest costs by a fair bit until the early 2010s. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore &amp;amp; reason why the current &amp;lt; 50-year-olds have to think twice about how much real estate.
At today&amp;rsquo;s prices, real estate is unlikely to beat inflation + interest costs in the long run.

Leverage in times like these usually accentuates the fall.
Leverage is like WMD (Weapon of mass destruction), resulting in excesses both on the way up and down. When markets fall, long leveraged positions are required to bring additional margins, failing which positions are forced to exit resulting in the markets falling even more.</description></item><item><title>Government taxes on Crypto could have been blessing in disguise</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/government-taxes-on-crypto-could-have-been-blessing-in-disguise-for-indian-crypto-investors/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/government-taxes-on-crypto-could-have-been-blessing-in-disguise-for-indian-crypto-investors/</guid><description>I think many Indian crypto investors accidentally got lucky due to TDS &amp;amp; Tax on Crypto announcement this budget in Feb.

The order placed is mostly sent to a market maker—typically hedge funds, that will either be the counterparty to the trade or send them to the US exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Console portfolio visualization</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/console-portfolio-visualization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/console-portfolio-visualization/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re all searching for stocks that always go up.

Hopefully, this high court order will put an end to what feels like a regressive tax by big tech, especially on SMEs.
Years ago, when our competitors first ran ads against the &amp;ldquo;Zerodha&amp;rdquo; keyword, we got influenced to run ads as well. We stopped quickly when we realized that it made no difference to our traffic &amp;amp; the ad was essentially cannibalizing our organic traffic while costing us money.</description></item><item><title>Wrong estimates of trading activity, market size and market share</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/wrong-estimates-of-trading-activity-market-size-and-market-share/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/wrong-estimates-of-trading-activity-market-size-and-market-share/</guid><description>Even to this day, a lot of people misconstrue the turnover numbers declared by the exchanges. This often leads to wrong estimates of trading activity and market size &amp;amp; share. So if A buys stock X for Rs 1lk &amp;amp; B sells for Rs 1lk, the exchange turnover = Rs 1lk &amp;amp; not Rs 2lks.
To calculate market size estimates based on exchange turnovers, the right way would be to multiply the exchange turnover by 2 and then calculate the %.</description></item><item><title>The idea behind Rainmatter Foundation</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-idea-behind-rainmatter-foundation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-idea-behind-rainmatter-foundation/</guid><description>Rainmatter Foundation started with the question of what&amp;rsquo;s the point of all this success if we don&amp;rsquo;t have a planet to live on?

You can now use Iceberg orders on Kite to slice large orders into smaller legs that are executed only once the previous leg is, helping reduce impact costs.
Impact cost, or the money a trader loses in the bid-ask spreads, increases substantially with high volumes or overtrading.

For most naked option writers, the losses in a volatile month may equal profits made over a long time period.

Securities lending: Unlike India, stocks are held in the street name or in the name of brokers—they can lend them to earn.</description></item><item><title>Impact of 1% TDS on all Crypto trades</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</guid><description>They say the devil is in the details.

With this 1% TDS, I think Crypto volumes in India will drop off the cliff come July 1st 2022 when it is implemented.
A 1% TDS means 1% of every trade value is blocked by the platform.</description></item><item><title>Tax arbitrage between dividends and selling a stake and startup profitability</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</guid><description>Can the tax arbitrage that exists between earning through dividends(~52%) vs earning through selling a stake (~24%) be the reason why most new-age businesses are not profitable? I think so. Money is like a river, it flows where the conditions are conducive to its flow.
The Govt capping the surcharge on LTCG when investing in unlisted companies to encourage investments in startups in the budget is a welcome move. But maybe the tax arbitrage shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so large that everyone just focuses on valuations and not on profits &amp;amp; sustainability.</description></item><item><title>Unauthorised CFD and forex trading platforms</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/unauthorised-cfd-and-forex-trading-platforms/</guid><description>We had cautioned people about illegal CFD &amp;amp; Forex &amp;amp; Binary trading platforms a while back, but I still keep seeing those ads, which means people still losing money.

Here&amp;rsquo;s my reading of crypto post the budget.
The 30% tax without the option to set-off of losses against other tokens or deductions can lead to a drop in turnover.

Lower txn costs improve liquidity, hence decrease impact costs.

Yes, when you buy options the max you can lose is the premium you have paid. But to get a sense of risk and how fast or easily you can lose, you should look at the exposure or contract value, not the premium.

Averaging down or buying more of an asset, be it stock or crypto, as the price keeps going down and hoping that the price bounces to recover losses or make profits faster. Common behaviour among retail investors.
While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run.

If exchange offers 50x leverage &amp;amp; say Bitcoin goes down 4% in one tick, a customer with $1K, can lose $2K.</description></item><item><title>On the Panic With Friends podcast with Howard Lindzon</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/panic-with-friends-podcast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/panic-with-friends-podcast/</guid><description>This was a really fun conversation with Howard.</description></item><item><title>Helping people take care of mental health during</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/taking-care-of-yourself/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/taking-care-of-yourself/</guid><description>While we figure ways to help those directly affected by Corona, I think it is also super important that all of us take care of ourselves.

Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description></item><item><title>Podcast with Prateek Singh, the founder of LearnApp</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/podcast-with-prateek-learnapp/</guid><description>From the start at Zerodha, we&amp;rsquo;ve constantly shared things to educate people about the capital markets.

Easier for employees of banks, brokerages, wealth management firms to mis-sell as relationships are already established &amp;amp; there is trust with the brand, which is why the customer has allowed them to be custodians of their assets.</description></item><item><title>How to know when odds are higher?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-to-know-when-odds-are-higher/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-to-know-when-odds-are-higher/</guid><description>Got a few questions about this tweet.

We&amp;rsquo;ll see a drop in trading volumes and an increase in impact cost. But in the long term, more traders will survive &amp;amp; hopefully make up for the dip.
There is an argument to be made for lesser intraday margins. VAR+ELM or SPAN+Exposure margin calculation is based on risk/volatility. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate between intraday &amp;amp; overnight risk, or that intraday is less risky and hence ideally requires lesser margins.</description></item><item><title>Trading with other people’s money</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/trading-with-other-peoples-money/</guid><description>Managing other people&amp;rsquo;s money in ways that aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed leads to the most complaints with the regulators.

Most trades are leveraged &amp;amp; ideally we should look at the margins being traded, not the trade value. Turnover this way will be less than 10% of the trading turnover declared.
The best way to estimate the size of the Indian capital markets is by checking the revenue pool.

As counterintuitive as it sounds, maybe the inability to easily enter/exit large public or illiquid private holdings forces fund managers to sit tight, which is also why they can outperform retail investors who are always trying to time the market.</description></item><item><title>The flipside of effecient companies</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-flipside-of-effecient-companies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-flipside-of-effecient-companies/</guid><description>https://zenx.medium.com/the-six-dots-problem-re-imagining-india-b7d81b223827 The flip side of tech-first businesses like ours is that we don&amp;rsquo;t create as many jobs. We are around the same number of employees today at 3.8mn clients as we were when we had 1mn clients. As @kunalb11 says, inefficiency is the biggest employer in the world. A way to solve this employment problem is to enable jobs(economy) not just in the top 6 cities, but maybe 600 towns/villages.

Almost unreal that we could represent Zerodha on the cover of Forbes. Some personal lessons from the many highs &amp;amp; many lows in this 20-year journey working, trading, trying to build different types of businesses, &amp;amp; more.
Businesses can be built in multiple ways. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to cut-copy-paste what others are doing - it mostly won’t work. Do what feels right to you. Your instincts on what is right will work better when you build a business/career around what you love.</description></item><item><title>The real hockey stick growth worth chasing</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-real-hockey-stick-growth-worth-chasing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-real-hockey-stick-growth-worth-chasing/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;The real hockey curve growth we all need to be chasing - seeds (maybe not companies)&amp;quot;. @zenx said while handing over these 50 odd seeds.
