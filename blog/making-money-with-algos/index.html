While an algo doesn&rsquo;t have emotions, it is only as good as the person who wrote it or controls (start & stop) it—the same person who&rsquo;s riddled with fear and greed.</p><p>Every algo like any trader, strategy or stock, has ups & downs. Just like impatient discretionary traders constantly try to time entry & exit, getting in late & out early, trade against trends, the same happens with algo traders trying to constantly find the best algo as well.</p><p>There is “no easy&rdquo; way to consistently generate profits by trading—be it discretionary, following &ldquo;experts&rdquo; or algos. The way to increase the odds of winning is by keeping fear & greed in check. For most people, trading only with money they can afford to lose is the way to go.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1448541188240207873?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/trading>trading</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Sanyam Aggarwal &copy; 2022</footer></body></html>
