This is a question I get asked often, more recently. I usually say, if you can tell me the Nifty direction or volatility, I can tell you what the broking industry will do.

It took >10 years to reach the high made in 2008 in terms of new user addition (total NSDL + CDSL Demat). Revenues are based on market volatility. The more the market moves, the higher the revenues generated.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1417096644756078595?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/business>business</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Sanyam Aggarwal &copy; 2022</footer></body></html>
