Disasters are bound to continue. The only real solution is to have many smaller cities with their own economies. Over 50% of our team now live there; a silver lining from Covid. If companies can afford to have teams work remotely or through small satellite offices, I think they should nudge teams to work out of small towns & cities. This way, the company can play a part in problem-solving. Moving to another large city will only be a temporary fix.</p><p>The quality of life can go up significantly, with more bang for the buck, more savings, lesser time in traffic, better work-life balance, & more.
This isn&rsquo;t just a hypothesis anymore; we now have enough data from our team, many of whom have moved to Mysuru & Belgavi. The best part is if these people consume locally, it can also help in terms of climate change issues & creation of livelihood, probably the two biggest problems we are facing as a nation. Otherwise, money keeps circulating in the large cities, enticing everyone to migrate.</p><p>This is what we are chasing through our foundation, <a href=https://twitter.com/RainmatterOrg>Rainmatter Org</a>, backing organisations working on helping smaller towns and villages to be self-sustainable, help <a href=rainmatter.org>create livelihoods and more.</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nithin0dha/status/1568173442238939137?s=20&t=0rPMELVmIqnPU-86wTO8Yg" rel="noopener noreferrer">View on Twitter &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags><ul class=flat><li><a href=/tags/rainmatter-foundation>rainmatter-foundation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Nithin Kamath &copy; 2021
