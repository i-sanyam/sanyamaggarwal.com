Despite working in a brokerage firm and my best efforts, I have been unable to help him consolidate his investments and help him exit the wasteful investments.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sure many Indians must be facing the same problem, just like my dad. As a first step towards attempting to solve it, we are helping our customers have a consolidated <a href=https://zerodha.com/z-connect/console/introducing-family-portfolio-view-on-console>family portfolio view</a> across Zerodha accounts.</p><p>Hopefully, all banks, depositories, & insurance companies go live on the account aggregator framework <a href=%5Bhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/sahamati/%5D(https://twitter.com/sahamati)>Sahamati</a> soon. The plan is to then work on offering a consolidated portfolio view across all assets, including insurance, & provide an easy way to liquidate whenever needed.</p><p><a href rel="noopener noreferrer">Go to link &rarr;</a></p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Sanyam Aggarwal &copy; 2022</footer></body></html>
