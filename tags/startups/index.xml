Hopefully, this high court order will put an end to what feels like a regressive tax by big tech, especially on SMEs.
Years ago, when our competitors first ran ads against the &amp;ldquo;Zerodha&amp;rdquo; keyword, we got influenced to run ads as well. We stopped quickly when we realized that it made no difference to our traffic &amp;amp; the ad was essentially cannibalizing our organic traffic while costing us money.</description></item><item><title>How large is the Indian market for B2C tech businesses and fintechs by revenue potential?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-large-is-the-indian-market-for-b2c-tech-businesses-and-fintechs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-large-is-the-indian-market-for-b2c-tech-businesses-and-fintechs/</guid><description>How large is the Indian market for B2C tech businesses in terms of users who can generate revenue? Maybe 15 crores max! Here&amp;rsquo;s why, with Fintech as a reference, since some data is available. I guess it is important to know this, so we can all be rationally optimistic.
I get puzzled whenever someone says India has 140cr people &amp;amp; only 9cr demat accounts (6% of the population), &amp;amp; this can grow to 40 crores (25% as in developed nations) over the next few years.</description></item><item><title>The end of growth at any cost?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-end-of-growth-at-any-cost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-end-of-growth-at-any-cost/</guid><description>The sharp fall in the stock prices of high growth tech companies across the globe is getting crazy, feels like the dot-com boom. India has weathered the storm mostly because not many such companies are listed &amp;amp; many private ones raised a lot of money last year.
It is ridiculous how quickly the expectations changed from growth at all costs to generating free cash flows to survive the next 2 to 3 years since raising funds might be tougher.</description></item><item><title>Why are billions being invested into Indian non-profitable startups by VCs?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-are-billions-being-invested-into-indian-startups-by-vs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-are-billions-being-invested-into-indian-startups-by-vs/</guid><description>Why are billions being invested into Indian non-profitable startups by VCs when it is well known that today the cost of acquisition (CAC) is much higher than the lifetime value (LTV) of customers in most B2C businesses? They have two hypotheses:
India is at around $2K per capita GDP, and the bet is that it will be at $4K in a few years from now. $4K is when the magic is supposed to happen, as it did in China.</description></item><item><title>Is fractional share investing possible in India?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/is-fractional-investing-possible-in-india/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/is-fractional-investing-possible-in-india/</guid><description>Fractional investing or the ability to invest say $10 in Amazon at $3200 has been the biggest reason for stock market participation to go up in the US. We applied under SEBI regulatory sandbox to launch the same in India. Our learnings by Somnath Mukherjee. We made that application with a startup that had reached out to us Rainmatterin and was rejected.
In the US, stocks bought by customers are held in the street name of the broker, unlike in India, where stocks are held in a customer’s beneficiary account with a depository.</description></item><item><title>How is Zerodha profitable when most new-age startups aren't?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-is-zerodha-profitable-when-most-new-age-startups-arent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-is-zerodha-profitable-when-most-new-age-startups-arent/</guid><description>We get asked often how is Zerodha profitable when most new-age companies aren&amp;rsquo;t. The answer is simple: our cost of acquisition (CAC) is 0. If we had to spend heavily, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. CAC at 0 is a philosophical decision, a bit like Dr K on hiring &amp;amp; building products. Philosophical because we aren&amp;rsquo;t in a hurry to grow or get to X valuation. We believe that if you can build products with the customers&amp;rsquo; best interests at heart and enjoy the journey as a team, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to do okay.</description></item><item><title>Can brokerage go to 0 in India?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/can-brokerage-go-to-0-in-india/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/can-brokerage-go-to-0-in-india/</guid><description>Many people ask me if brokerage rates can go to zero like in the US, and why not flat monthly brokerage plans with unlimited trades. I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I think, if anything, brokerage rates will go up in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.
Firstly, in the US, brokers can earn in ways that SEBI rightly doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow here: Payment for order flow: selling customer orders to HFT firms. Securities lending: Unlike India, stocks are held in the street name or in the name of brokers—they can lend them to earn.</description></item><item><title>Tax arbitrage between dividends and selling a stake and startup profitability</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/tax-arbitrage-between-dividends-and-selling-stake/</guid><description>Can the tax arbitrage that exists between earning through dividends(~52%) vs earning through selling a stake (~24%) be the reason why most new-age businesses are not profitable? I think so. Money is like a river, it flows where the conditions are conducive to its flow.
The Govt capping the surcharge on LTCG when investing in unlisted companies to encourage investments in startups in the budget is a welcome move. But maybe the tax arbitrage shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so large that everyone just focuses on valuations and not on profits &amp;amp; sustainability.</description></item><item><title>Private market valautions are weird</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/private-market-valuations-are-weird/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/private-market-valuations-are-weird/</guid><description>While listed high growth, yet to be profitable startups are seeing sharp drops, private market valuations are somehow still holding up. Weird times we live in. Btw if there was a way to short private companies, I think there are a few pair trades—shorting private &amp;amp; buying listed.</description></item><item><title>Lower volatility long term growth vs maximum short term gain</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/long-term-gain-vs-short-term-gain/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/long-term-gain-vs-short-term-gain/</guid><description>The sharp drops in stock prices of listed new-age tech companies across the world is quite scary. If history is a guide, only a small % of them will maybe bounce back. Companies when projecting growth should maybe prioritize lower volatility long term vs max short term gain.
The networth of the core teams in most new-age businesses is tied to ESOPs &amp;amp; hence valuations. Most, including the founders, suffer from anchoring bias.</description></item><item><title>Building for India but incorporating outside India is a disturbing trend</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/startups-incorporating-outside-india/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/startups-incorporating-outside-india/</guid><description>New startups building for India but incorporating outside India is a disturbing trend. While even now startups are largely funded by foreign VCs, there is wealth creation in India through Founders, Angels, &amp;amp; ESOPs. Also, the taxes on realized capital gains benefit India.
Since most startups now prioritize growth over profits, there&amp;rsquo;s typically no income tax in India. Now if all wealth creation and capital gains are also captured outside, it is like that dialogue from Swades - &amp;ldquo;Apni chaukhat ka diya, giving light to neighbour&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>A must watch interview of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</guid><description>This RJ chat is a must-watch
The common thing among successful traders &amp;amp; entrepreneurs is to always think in terms of risk to reward. They take a trade—buy a stock or take a business bet—only if they&amp;rsquo;ve made peace with the worst possible outcome
An understanding that leverage (debt) is merciless &amp;amp; a double-edged sword. If at all they need to use leverage, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small portion of their networth.</description></item><item><title>Why are we valuing ourselves at just $2 Billion</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-are-we-valuing-zerodha-at-2-billion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-are-we-valuing-zerodha-at-2-billion/</guid><description>The only reason why we do a valuation exercise at Zerodha every year is for our ESOP buyback. I keep getting asked why are we valuing ourselves at just $2Billion currently when smaller players are raising money at far higher valuations. Here is why we&amp;rsquo;re conservative.
Some background: We don&amp;rsquo;t promise ESOPs for anyone on our team. Frankly, we never thought we were building something that could become so valuable. So we never thought of ESOPs.</description></item><item><title>On "Powered by AI / ML" marketing</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/on-powered-by-ai-ml-marketing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/on-powered-by-ai-ml-marketing/</guid><description>The note yesterday on &amp;ldquo;Powered by AI&amp;rdquo; hype got surprising amounts of attention.

Growth is usually a function of agility &amp;amp; product bets. Since these companies take more bets &amp;amp; are more agile &amp;amp; aggressive than traditional businesses, they grow faster (Zerodha as well).
The question then, will the ability of these companies to be agile (reason for growth) reduce because of all the scrutiny that comes by being publicly listed?</description></item><item><title>Why doesn't Zerodha advertise?</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-doesnt-zerodha-advertise/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-doesnt-zerodha-advertise/</guid><description>One thing I get asked the most and I’ve tweeted about this numerous times is that why don’t we advertise. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;d shared this sometime back.
Unlike buying a mobile phone or ordering a pizza, you don&amp;rsquo;t invest in stocks &amp;amp; MFs impulsively. Most often than not, we invest because of greed or because of our friends. And regulations don&amp;rsquo;t allow you to advertise greed.
Ads do help you create visibility and build credibility - two really important things in the business of money, especially the first few years.</description></item><item><title>Right now is probably the stupidest time for fintech firms</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-stupidest-time-to-be-raising-money/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-stupidest-time-to-be-raising-money/</guid><description>Right now, is probably the stupidest time for fintech firms like @zerodhaonline to be raising money.
