Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, sits on a lotus. Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, sits on a rock.
The symbolism is that money, like a lotus floats &amp;amp; knowledge, like a rock once gained stays forever</description></item><item><title>Importance of health insurance and regular health checkups</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/importance-of-health-insurance-and-regular-health-checkups/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/importance-of-health-insurance-and-regular-health-checkups/</guid><description>Have been getting a lot of questions on selecting health insurance &amp;amp; regular health checkups. It&amp;rsquo;s super important to have adequate health &amp;amp; term insurance. So I asked Shrehith at Ditto, an expert on insurance, to share a few pointers and also answer questions.</description></item><item><title>My wife Seema's cancer journey</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/my-wife-seemas-cancer-journey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/my-wife-seemas-cancer-journey/</guid><description>Seema, my wife, was diagnosed with breast cancer last Nov.

As you do or make more, you get into bubbles where you benchmark yourself to those who have more, and you want it. So that chase never ends?
It&amp;rsquo;s accentuated with famous folks &amp;amp; successful founders seeking constant validation. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy how people around me think I have answers to all life&amp;rsquo;s problems just because of whatever little success I&amp;rsquo;ve had.</description></item><item><title>Importance of sleep on overall health &amp; well-being</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/importance-of-sleep-on-overall-health-and-well-being/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/importance-of-sleep-on-overall-health-and-well-being/</guid><description>The number of people having severe heart issues in my extended circle is terrifying. The common thread seems to be sleep deprivation, and not nearly enough is spoken about the importance of sleep on overall health &amp;amp; well-being. The problem has gotten worse post-COVID &amp;amp; WFH.
If you, like me, have trouble sleeping because of constant work distractions, triggers from email, news apps, social media, and chats, disconnecting completely—I mean full cold turkey—a few hours before sleep helps significantly.</description></item><item><title>A must watch interview of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</guid><description>This RJ chat is a must-watch
The common thing among successful traders &amp;amp; entrepreneurs is to always think in terms of risk to reward. They take a trade—buy a stock or take a business bet—only if they&amp;rsquo;ve made peace with the worst possible outcome
An understanding that leverage (debt) is merciless &amp;amp; a double-edged sword. If at all they need to use leverage, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small portion of their networth.</description></item><item><title>Nature Shows How This All Works</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-things-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/how-things-work/</guid><description>Nature shows how this all works (markets too) Extreme events in one direction increase the odds of extreme events in the other Small changes compounded for long periods of time are indistinguishable from magic A beautiful read by Morgan Housel</description></item><item><title>In-Principle approval for our AMC</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/made-in-india-cars/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/made-in-india-cars/</guid><description>The new cars from M&amp;amp;M &amp;amp; Tata have to be making each one of us feeling proudFlag of India Finally feels like we can not only beat international cars in the same segment in pricing but also in terms of the look &amp;amp; feel.

Luxuries soon become necessities, X constantly grows. In a world where everyone is triggering you to borrow &amp;amp; buy what you don’t need, being content &amp;amp; debt-free is true financial freedom.

It is quite crazy the number of folks reaching out &amp;amp; the different deals. We might regret it in the future, but we are not raising &amp;amp; here are the counterintuitive reasons why.
We don’t need the money, so there’s no point in raising money just because someone is ready to give it to you.</description></item><item><title>a career highpoint</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/a-career-highpoint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/a-career-highpoint/</guid><description>Dad&amp;rsquo;s first time on screen.
