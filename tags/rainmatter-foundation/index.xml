We hope to create an open playbook that can be replicated elsewhere to create many more EBTLs.
Make sure to read the brilliant project updates by Team Ananas, who are executing the restoration based on permaculture principles. We hope to have workshops at EBTL soon, share learnings, &amp;amp; provide help to anyone attempting similar projects across the country.</description></item><item><title>Social stock exchange can making investing for the future mainstream</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/social-stock-exchange-can-make-investing-for-the-future-mainstream/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/social-stock-exchange-can-make-investing-for-the-future-mainstream/</guid><description>The second-biggest problem for the planet outside climate change is the concentration of wealth unless it helps society. Now that SEBI has put a framework on the Social stock exchange (SSE), we are excited to see how we can nudge the top 5% of India to think of the bottom 80%.
For anybody who wants to invest in the future, the biggest challenge is the trust deficit. Non-profits that list on the SSE have to adhere to regulations &amp;amp; make disclosures like listed companies.</description></item><item><title>Indian cities weren't built to handle their current population</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/indian-cities-werent-built-to-handle-their-current-population.md/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/indian-cities-werent-built-to-handle-their-current-population.md/</guid><description>Most large Indian cities weren&amp;rsquo;t built in a way to handle as many people living in them today. Disasters are bound to continue. The only real solution is to have many smaller cities with their own economies. Over 50% of our team now live there; a silver lining from Covid. If companies can afford to have teams work remotely or through small satellite offices, I think they should nudge teams to work out of small towns &amp;amp; cities.</description></item><item><title>A little more forest everywhere</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/a-little-more-forrest-everywhere/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/a-little-more-forrest-everywhere/</guid><description>Through Rainmatter Organisation, we support organizations working on climate change issues. But we understand that the biggest impact can be made by individuals. Planting trees is a good start &amp;amp; we have been trying to help by giving free saplings.

Despite the success of Zerodha, we’re still only helping ~ 2-3% of Indians. At the same time, our planet is facing an existential threat due to climate change. So we asked ourselves—what if we could use our learnings &amp;amp; experiences from building Zerodha to help make a difference.</description></item><item><title>The risk of holding crypto assets with crypto exchanges</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-risk-of-holding-crypto-assets-with-crypto-exchanges/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-risk-of-holding-crypto-assets-with-crypto-exchanges/</guid><description>Coinbase&amp;rsquo;s latest filing: Customer assets could be at risk in case of bankruptcy.
