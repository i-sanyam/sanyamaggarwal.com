We saw this with Yes bank, Reliance ADAG stocks, and now with Zomato. Investing is risky &amp;amp; here are some important things retail investors should keep in mind
In the business of investing, if a stock price is down and it seems like it is a cheap buy, odds are, it will continue to become cheaper.</description></item><item><title>Cybercrime risks when trading</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/cybercrime-risks-when-trading/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/cybercrime-risks-when-trading/</guid><description>Thanks to Anil Singhvi and Zee Business for highlighting the cybercrime risks when trading the markets. Cybercrime has gone up across banking to broking to social media. We must be extra vigilant. Here&amp;rsquo;s everything we&amp;rsquo;re doing at Zerodha.
Money cannot be withdrawn from trading accounts to 3rd party bank accounts. To move money, fraudsters create artificial losses by trading illiquid options (buy high, sell low) or buying scammy penny stocks. Our best bet is to find ways to block such suspicious trades.</description></item><item><title>Follow up on thoughts on real estate performance</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/follow-up-thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/follow-up-thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</guid><description>The question to ask when investing in real estate: Is the property yield greater than inflation?
Yield = ((Rent – interest - maintenance)/Total cost)%
If yield -ve, the price has to go up by at least 10% per yr to beat inflation, or the price has to double every ~7 years.
For the price of the property to double every 7 yrs, the rents also have to go up as much.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on real estate performance</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/thoughts-on-real-estate-performance/</guid><description>Being overexposed to real estate worked well for the current &amp;gt; 50-year-olds, as returns beat inflation+interest costs by a fair bit until the early 2010s. But that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore &amp;amp; reason why the current &amp;lt; 50-year-olds have to think twice about how much real estate.
At today&amp;rsquo;s prices, real estate is unlikely to beat inflation + interest costs in the long run. A house will provide financial &amp;amp; emotional security, but financial returns as an investment won&amp;rsquo;t be enough to cover for retirement as in the past.</description></item><item><title>Why I stopped trading</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-i-stopped-trading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/why-i-stopped-trading/</guid><description>I get asked often, why stop trading? Trading isn&amp;rsquo;t just trading stocks, It&amp;rsquo;s trading your time and efforts to do things, where the risk to reward is most in your favour. While I have stopped trading stocks actively, Zerodha is by far the biggest trade of my life.
Nikhil Kamath is a much better trader than me. When we started, idea was he would trade &amp;amp; I attempt to build Zerodha.</description></item><item><title>Impressive yields on Government Securities</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impressive.yields.on.government.securities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impressive.yields.on.government.securities/</guid><description>One of those times when Govt T-Bills are yielding more than most 1-year fixed deposit rates of banks.

Zerodha customers alone pay ~₹2500 cores in STT, stamp duty, &amp;amp; GST annually. Overall, traders lose more money in transaction costs &amp;amp; impact costs than to the markets.
Lower txn costs improve liquidity, hence decrease impact costs. But on flip side, you could argue that people may speculate more, which isn&amp;rsquo;t good—one reason for Nudges on Kite.</description></item><item><title>Advisory is one the biggest Indian fintech opportunity</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-biggest-fintech-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/the-biggest-fintech-opportunity/</guid><description>One of the biggest Indian fintech opportunities is advisory to help Indians manage their personal finances better—investments, insurance etc. For this to happen, Account aggregator will have to do what UPI did for payments.

Imagine, instead of gold, some of that money was invested in Indian startups &amp;amp; listed companies. There could&amp;rsquo;ve been immense and inclusive local wealth creation.
I think the goal of every Indian fintech firm focusing on savings and investing should be to nudge people to back Indian entrepreneurs and think long term.</description></item><item><title>A must watch interview of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/must-watch-interview-of-rakesh-jhunjhunwala/</guid><description>This RJ chat is a must-watch
The common thing among successful traders &amp;amp; entrepreneurs is to always think in terms of risk to reward. They take a trade—buy a stock or take a business bet—only if they&amp;rsquo;ve made peace with the worst possible outcome
An understanding that leverage (debt) is merciless &amp;amp; a double-edged sword. If at all they need to use leverage, it&amp;rsquo;s only a small portion of their networth.</description></item><item><title>Illiquidity premium</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/illquidity-and-the-temptation-of-selling-quick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/illquidity-and-the-temptation-of-selling-quick/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve asked a lot of successful MF, PE &amp;amp; VC managers if they would be able to resist the temptation to time the market and hold on to profitable investments if they could easily exit &amp;amp; enter investments like retail investors. The answer is almost always &amp;ldquo;hmm&amp;hellip; probably, not&amp;rdquo;.
The inability to time the market due to size constraints &amp;amp; illiquidity—especially in private markets forces fund managers to follow the fundamental investing rule—letting your winners run.</description></item><item><title>Nudging users to help them avoid mistakes</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/nudging-users-to-help-them-avoid-mistakes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/nudging-users-to-help-them-avoid-mistakes/</guid><description>Most people don&amp;rsquo;t spend time learning trading or forget what they&amp;rsquo;ve learnt when placing an order.

Averaging down or buying more of an asset, be it stock or crypto, as the price keeps going down and hoping that the price bounces to recover losses or make profits faster. Common behaviour among retail investors.
While it is tempting to average down, the odds of this strategy working are significantly low in the long run. All it takes is one large move on the other side for things to go wrong.</description></item><item><title>The risk of offering high leverages</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/risk-of-offering-high-leverages/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/risk-of-offering-high-leverages/</guid><description>When a platform offers leverage or funds the customer to buy for more than the money in the account, the platform takes a credit risk. With Crypto exchanges offering 10 to 100x leverage (futures), on days like today, I wonder who monitors liquidity position of these platforms.
In regulated space, even with all checks &amp;amp; balances, brokerage firms once in a while on days of extreme volatility go bust. If exchange offers 50x leverage &amp;amp; say Bitcoin goes down 4% in one tick, a customer with $1K, can lose $2K.</description></item><item><title>On the Panic With Friends podcast with Howard Lindzon</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/panic-with-friends-podcast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/panic-with-friends-podcast/</guid><description>This was a really fun conversation with Howard.</description></item><item><title>The pandemic has shown us it's the right time to move away from cities</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/moving-away-from-large-cities/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/moving-away-from-large-cities/</guid><description>While we all work together to figure out what we can do to help in the current situation, I think the only long-term fix is for as many of us to move away from large cities. This is the answer to many of India’s problems. And now is probably the right time to work towards it.
Large cities are choking &amp;amp; will continue to break down every time we&amp;rsquo;re tested, COVID today, could be water shortages, pollution, floods, etc.</description></item><item><title>Mis-selling is a systemic issue.</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/misselling-is-a-systemic-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/misselling-is-a-systemic-issues/</guid><description>This is a more systemic issue, not with one bank but across the board, banks to ed-tech to fintech. As long as you give revenue targets &amp;amp; push employees to get there, products that generate more revenue for the business over what is right for the customer will be mis-sold.
Easier for employees of banks, brokerages, wealth management firms to mis-sell as relationships are already established &amp;amp; there is trust with the brand, which is why the customer has allowed them to be custodians of their assets.</description></item><item><title>A nudge to stop people from losing money in Rights Entitlements</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/nudge-to-stop-people-from-losing-money-in-rights-entitlements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/nudge-to-stop-people-from-losing-money-in-rights-entitlements/</guid><description>Many retail investors buy Rights Entitlements (REs) without knowing that the value of REs will be zero if they don&amp;rsquo;t apply.

If you are looking at gold as an investment, Sovereign gold bonds followed by Gold ETF/MFs are the best option.</description></item></channel></rss>
