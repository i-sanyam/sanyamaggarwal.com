Activity &amp;amp; participation dropped significantly immediately. If not, many could have potentially been trapped trying to buy the dip &amp;amp; then averaging down.
Even when trading stocks, the biggest reason for losses is trying to make a wrong trade right by throwing good money at bad money. That is averaging down when the price moves against the trade, without considering if the portfolio is getting concentrated or not.</description></item><item><title>Impact of 1% TDS on all Crypto trades</title><link>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://i-sanyam.github.io/blog/impact-of-1-percent-tds-on-all-crypto-trades/</guid><description>They say the devil is in the details. I missed the 1% TDS on all Crypto trades, similar to the TCS of 0.1% on Gold. I assumed that the TDS is only on the gains. With this 1% TDS, I think Crypto volumes in India will drop off the cliff come July 1st 2022 when it is implemented.
A 1% TDS means 1% of every trade value is blocked by the platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
