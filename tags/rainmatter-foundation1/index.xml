We RainmatterOrg were blown away when we first met Zerocircle who are working on an alternative to plastic using seaweed.
Zerocircle is building a compostable &amp;amp; ocean-safe alternative to plastics from farmed seaweed, which dissolves harmlessly in the ocean after use. These are the ideas that really need to scale so that they lower costs &amp;amp; achieve mass adoption for the sake of our planet.</description></item></channel></rss>
